# E-Commerce With Laravel 8

Electronic commerce or e-commerce (sometimes written as eCommerce) is a business model that lets firms and individuals buy and sell things over the internet. E-commerce operates in all four of the following major market segments: Business to business. Business to consumer. Consumer to consumer. [Source](https://www.investopedia.com). The operation mode used in this project is Business to Consumer. 
Hopefully, another project that supports more modes would be created.

## Installation

Laravel has a very good documentation on installation, follow this [link](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/installation) to install Laravel 8 on your device. 

Additionally, you could use this [Medium Post Link](https://medium.com/@owthub/laravel-8-installation-guide-php-framework-de42e145765c)... The installation guide could not be explained better.
